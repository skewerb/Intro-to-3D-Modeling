## So what is a 3D model?

A [3D model][model] is essentially a mathematical representation of a three-dimensional surface of an object. These models are typically created using programs such as [Maya][maya], [3ds Max][3dsmax] or the open-source program, [Blender][blender]. No matter which program you decide to use, the skills you learn in this book will be *mostly* transferable. This book will be using [Maya LT 2015][mayalt] to teach these concepts.
